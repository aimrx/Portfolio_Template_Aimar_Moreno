AI Agent Usage Policy: If you use AI assistants, include a clear section in your README describing when and how the AI was used. Critical: Every AI interaction must follow a two-phase workflow:

Phase 1: Planning — Request a development plan from the AI
Phase 2: Implementation — Only after documenting the plan, proceed with code

docs/plan1.md — First feature/task (e.g., “Responsive Navigation Component”)
docs/plan2.md — Second feature/task (e.g., “GSAP Scroll Animations”)
docs/plan3.md — Third feature/task (e.g., “Contact Form Integration”)
Each plan file should contain:
Your prompt/question to the AI
The AI’s complete plan response
Brief notes on what was implemented from the plan
