## Reflection Questions

### What excites you most about this project?

What excites me the most is the idea of having bee able to create my own web portfolio template and that I will be able to improve over the time.

### What challenges do you anticipate?

The main idea of doing a website feels already challenge for me. However I already knew the animations and use of javascript was going to be challenging and more complicated than the html and css.

### How does this project connect to your learning goals?

My learning goals are everything that envolves web design. The development of a web portfolio template combines the web methodology, with my own design aesthetics.
